## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- JavaScript

### Continued development

I'll keep trying to get better at web programming as a whole. While taking this project I discovered I have to learn about using JSON Data in javascript which I found very helpful building my past few projects.
